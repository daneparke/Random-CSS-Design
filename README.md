## Branches

This repo has 2 branches:
  1. master
  2. breakout-complete

The master branch is the base starting point, whereas the breakout-complete branch contains the code from when the breakout was completed (at the end of the video). If you are starting fresh, work on the master branch. If you want to see what we produced together during the breakout, you can look at the breakout-complete branch on github or use the following command to view it on your local machine:

* git checkout breakout-complete

You can return to the master branch to write your own code:

* git checkout master

Or you can continue to work on the breakout-complete branch.
